# Welcome to Fortana

## Money Planning Without the Hassle of Budgeting

Fortana is a new money planning app designed specifically for people who don't like traditional budgeting. We understand that strict budget categories and penny tracking can feel restrictive and time-consuming.

### Why Fortana?

- **No Strict Budget Categories** - Plan your money your way without rigid constraints
- **Focus on What Matters** - Prioritize your financial goals without micromanaging every expense
- **Simple, Intuitive Interface** - Manage your finances with minimal effort
- **Smart Planning Tools** - Get insights and recommendations without traditional budgeting

### How It Works

Fortana takes a different approach to financial planning. Instead of asking you to categorize every dollar and track every penny, we help you:

1. Create a simple plan for your income
2. Track only what's important to you
3. Get insights without the headaches

### Get Started

Fortana will be launching soon! Stay tuned for more info!
