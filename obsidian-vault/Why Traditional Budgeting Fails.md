# Why Traditional Budgeting Fails for Most People

Traditional budgeting approaches work well for some people, but they have significant shortcomings that cause many to abandon their financial plans. Let's explore why conventional budgeting methods often fail.

## Too Rigid and Time-Consuming

Traditional budgeting typically involves:
- Categorizing every dollar of your income
- Tracking every expense meticulously
- Reconciling accounts regularly
- Feeling guilty about every "overspent" category

This level of detail requires significant time and mental energy that most people simply don't have in their busy lives.

## Doesn't Account for Real Life

Life is unpredictable. Traditional budgets often struggle with:
- Irregular income
- Unexpected expenses
- Changing priorities
- Emotional spending decisions

When your actual spending doesn't match your budget (which is inevitable), it's easy to feel like you've failed and give up entirely.

## Creates an Unhealthy Relationship with Money

For many people, traditional budgeting:
- Induces feelings of guilt and shame
- Creates anxiety around spending decisions
- Focuses on restriction rather than empowerment
- Doesn't account for the emotional aspects of money

## The Alternative: Flexible Money Planning

At Fortana, we believe in a different approach:
- Focus on your biggest financial goals
- Build sustainable money habits
- Track only what matters most

All of this with minimal time investment - it only takes a few minutes every month to create money plans!
